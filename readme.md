## Goals

The goal is to build a complex robot, made up of many simple project.

Projects are:

1. Functional - Can be used as-is. Rather than little experiments, these projects can be used in every-day life.
1. Kit friendly - Each project will have a breadboard, schematic and PCB layout along with instructions.
1. Accessible - Parts can be found off the shelf, or are easily obtainable. Nothing is a rare hard-to-find part. Ideally inexpensive as well.
1. Customizable - Make the end project look any way you like. This can be as simple as painting a project box, picking out an LED color, or arraning parts in a different way.
1. Presentable - Project boxes or 3D Printed parts enclose the electronic components to appear as a functional project that people can understand what it is.

## Projects

1. **Flashlight** - LED controlled by a switch
1. - Multiple switches to control multiple LEDs
1. Input & Output shift registers for multiple switches/LEDs
1. Wired Controller
1. Radio Frequency Controller
1. **Fan** (Motor)
1. **Osccilating fan** (Servo)
1. RC Car
1. Bumper car (Toggle switches)
1. Autonomouse car (IR Sensor)
1. Pathfinding (Stepper & Sonar)
1. Radar Screen (Sonar)
1. **Music Box** (SD Card & Audio Chip)
1. Status (LCD Display)
1. Data entry (Keyboard)
